run the following (as root or not, it does not matter)

$ ./autoconf.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
$ make

as root, run the following

# make install

to build packages run either of the following. note the prefix
and sysconfdir options are not needed but are equivelant to the
prior configure command.

$ ./autoconf.sh
$ ./configure
$ make rpm
$ make srpm

the resulting packages will be in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64 and
~/rpmbuild/SRPMS

the default for prefix if not specified on the configure command
is /usr/local.  without specifying prefix, the sysconfdir default is
/etc.  if prefix is given, the sysconfdir is needed as the result
without correcting it will be /usr/etc with is bad.
