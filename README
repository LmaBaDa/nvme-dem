Notes:

both jansson and mongoose are cloned from gitlab so initial make need to
be done on a system with internet access or otherwise copied to the system
before attempting to run make.

the test directory is a unit test for the transports which use the ops.h
include file to define the set of indirect functions call used in the dem.
the unit test is a simple client/server app to ensure a connection can be
made and distroyed as well as sending messages and doing rma reads and
writes
